# Star Wars Battle

This is a sample app using SWAPI `https://www.swapi.tech/` to compare between people (compares height) or starships (compers crew number).

## Assumptions and comments for the task

1. Did not care about the looks or RWD.
2. Did not test everything that normally should be tested, created only sample tests.
3. Did assume some things about the API.
4. Did not validate or catch everything, but showed that I'm capable of doing so.
5. Did not modularize that much, it is a small project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests.
